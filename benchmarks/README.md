# Benchmarks

This workspace contains all performance benchmarks for Runeweaver. It stays
separate so benchmark dependencies do not enter the published crates.

Run the complete suite from the repository root:

```console
cargo bench --manifest-path benchmarks/Cargo.toml
```

Criterion warms each case for one second. It then collects 200 samples over at
least three seconds. Reports use a 99% confidence level and a 1%
significance level. Flat sampling keeps the duration predictable for operations
that take several milliseconds. The pull request job has a 15-minute limit.

CI checks out the pull request base revision into a separate directory. It
copies the pull request benchmark suite there before it builds either revision.
Thus, both revisions use identical benchmark code on one runner.

Each case has a separate benchmark executable. CI removes build metadata from
each executable and compares both revisions. It measures only the cases whose
runtime content differs.

CI fails when the lower bound of the mean change exceeds 5%. Therefore, the
complete 99% confidence interval must show a slowdown greater than 5%. It also
maintains a pull request comment containing a short table of improvements and
regressions beyond that threshold; unchanged and uncertain results are omitted.

## Add a benchmark

Put each token definition in `cases/`. Use `token_definition!` with the same
attributes and variants that a Runeweaver lexer uses:

```rust
use crate::support::token_definition;

token_definition! {
    #[lexer(skip = r"[ \t\r\n]+")]
    pub enum Token {
        #[token("[a-z]+")]
        Word,
    }
}
```

The macro creates the derived token type and its codegen input. Add a matching
benchmark target to `Cargo.toml`. Add a wrapper in `benches/` that includes
`case_benchmark.rs`. The same form supports modes, payload fields, callbacks,
and transitions. The corresponding files in `cases/` show each feature in
isolation.

For a scanner benchmark, add a source file in `sources/`. Then register the
token type and the source with the shared scanner runner:

```rust
pub const SOURCE: &str = include_str!("../sources/words.txt");

scanner::benchmarks::<words::Token>(criterion, "words", words::SOURCE);
```

The runner expands small source files to at least 512 KiB. It automatically
measures slices, readers, and both lexeme-retaining forms.

Keep input creation and other setup outside the timed operation. Use
`iter_batched` when each iteration needs a new input value.

Pass inputs and outputs through `std::hint::black_box`. This prevents the
compiler from removing work that the benchmark must measure.

Set Criterion throughput metadata for byte or element processing. Use stable,
descriptive benchmark identifiers because CI uses them to match both revisions.

Use deterministic inputs that represent a documented operation. Make each
iteration do enough work to reduce timer overhead without hiding relevant costs.

The complete suite must compile against the base revision. Add a benchmark for
a new API after that API is present in the base revision.
